        Problem: the paragraph has no topic sentence Imagine each paragraph as a
        sandwich. The real content of the sandwich—the meat or other filling—is
        in the middle. It includes all the evidence you need to make the point.
        But it gets kind of messy to eat a sandwich without any bread. Your
        readers don’t know what to do with all the evidence you’ve given them.
        So, the top slice of bread (the first sentence of the paragraph)
        explains the topic (or controlling idea) of the paragraph. And, the
        bottom slice (the last sentence of the paragraph) tells the reader how
        the paragraph relates to the broader argument. In the original and
        revised paragraphs below, notice how a topic sentence expressing the
        controlling idea tells the reader the point of all the evidence.
        Original paragraph Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat
        smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans, piranhas’
        first instinct is to flee, not attack. Their fear of humans makes sense.
        Far more piranhas are eaten by people than people are eaten by piranhas.
        If the fish are well-fed, they won’t bite humans. Revised paragraph
        Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are,
        for the most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large
        animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with
        humans, piranhas’ first instinct is to flee, not attack. Their fear of
        humans makes sense. Far more piranhas are eaten by people than people
        are eaten by piranhas. If the fish are well-fed, they won’t bite humans.
        Once you have mastered the use of topic sentences, you may decide that
        the topic sentence for a particular paragraph really shouldn’t be the
        first sentence of the paragraph. This is fine—the topic sentence can
        actually go at the beginning, middle, or end of a paragraph; what’s
        important is that it is in there somewhere so that readers know what the
        main idea of the paragraph is and how it relates back to the thesis of
        your paper. Suppose that we wanted to start the piranha paragraph with a
        transition sentence—something that reminds the reader of what happened
        in the previous paragraph—rather than with the topic sentence. Let’s
        suppose that the previous paragraph was about all kinds of animals that
        people are afraid of, like sharks, snakes, and spiders. Our paragraph
        might look like this (the topic sentence is bold): Like sharks, snakes,
        and spiders, piranhas are widely feared. Although most people consider
        piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, for the most part, entirely
        harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish
        and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans, piranhas’ first
        instinct is to flee, not attack. Their fear of humans makes sense. Far
        more piranhas are eaten by people than people are eaten by piranhas. If
        the fish are well-fed, they won’t bite humans. Problem: the paragraph
        has more than one controlling idea If a paragraph has more than one main
        idea, consider eliminating sentences that relate to the second idea, or
        split the paragraph into two or more paragraphs, each with only one main
        idea. Watch our short video on reverse outlining to learn a quick way to
        test whether your paragraphs are unified. In the following paragraph,
        the final two sentences branch off into a different topic; so, the
        revised paragraph eliminates them and concludes with a sentence that
        reminds the reader of the paragraph’s main idea. Original paragraph
        Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are,
        for the most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large
        animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with
        humans, piranhas’ first instinct is to flee, not attack. Their fear of
        humans makes sense. Far more piranhas are eaten by people than people
        are eaten by piranhas. A number of South American groups eat piranhas.
        They fry or grill the fish and then serve them with coconut milk or
        tucupi, a sauce made from fermented manioc juices. Revised paragraph
        Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are,
        for the most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large
        animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with
