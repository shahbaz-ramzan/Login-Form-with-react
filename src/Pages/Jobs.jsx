        Finished paragraph Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively
        harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that
        piranhas are dangerous to humans. This impression of piranhas is
        exacerbated by their mischaracterization in popular media. For example,
        the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film Piranha features an
        oversized piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman. Such
        a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination and promotes
        unnecessary fear. While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends
        excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the
        real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans
        may finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.
